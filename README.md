# Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup: randart hell

(WIP) All generated weapons, armours, and jewelleries are randarts.
(untested) All artefects are auto-identified.
(WIP) Unlimited or expanded inventory.

## Pros:

* Your starting gear is artefacts.
* It's easy to get fully equipped with your pick of artefacts.

## Cons:

* All monster gear is also artefacts.
